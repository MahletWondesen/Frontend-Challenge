# 🧩 Auth Demo - Coding Challenge

A simple authentication-focused React + TypeScript app built with **Vite** (or **Next.js - client only**), showcasing:

- 🔐 Authentication (Sign-Up)
- 🌍 Global state management with Zustand
- 🔁 Data fetching with TanStack Query
- ✅ End-to-end type safety using Zod
- 🎨 Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- 🚀 Error handling and loading states

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **TanStack Query** – async data fetching
- **Zod** – schema validation
- **Tailwind CSS** – styling
- **Mock API** – simulates sign-up/login actions

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Sign-up form with validation
- 🔐 Tracks logged-in users globally
